### December 2023 Final Update

This repository is archived and will not be updated anymore. It was developed in 2021 as a part of my bachelor's final thesis and is used to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack web development. Since then I've moved on to different areas and projects.

In short, the idea of the project is to show understanding of the following web developent areas:
- appliance of distributed systems architecture, in this case multiple client-side architectures are used
- authentication and authorization via JWTs
- front-end development of the UI in React (javascript)
- back-end development of the server in Spring Boot (java)
- dedicated database usage for data storage and retrieval

For any additional information, feel free to reach out to me. The link to my LinkedIn profile is below.

### Short description
